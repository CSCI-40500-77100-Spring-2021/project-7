# STONKS Prototype

## Summary
We envisioned our prototype as a basic stock search. We implemented a navigation menu (navigation changes uri, but pages weren't created), search bar (input doesn't actually search), and a stock information display (info is static) with limited functionality.

## Instructions
1. `git clone https://github.com/CSCI-40500-77100-Spring-2021/project-7.git`
2. `cd project-7`
3. `npm install` - Install app dependencies
4. `npm start` - Run the app in the development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
