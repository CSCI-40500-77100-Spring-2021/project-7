# STONKS Prototype Extension

## Product Vision

FOR students WHO want to learn more about investing, THE STONKS is an educational/financial web
application THAT is tailored to students with little money or knowledge of the stock market. UNLIKE Robinhood and other trading brokerages, OUR product provides the foundational knowledge on how to start investing in the stock market.

## Summary

We envisioned our prototype as a basic stock search. We implemented a navigation menu (navigation changes uri, but pages weren't created), search bar (input doesn't actually search), and a stock information display (info is static) with limited functionality.

## Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/CSCI-40500-77100-Spring-2021/project-7.git`
2. `cd project-7`
3. `npm install` - Install app dependencies
4. `npm start` - Run the app in the development mode.
5. After you install everything go to localhost:3000 and enter stock ticker
